# Functional Components vs. Class Components 

In Javascript functions and classes are units of abstraction which allow us to encapsulate groups of data and the operations we perform on them. This is helpful because it allows us to break big problems into smaller sub problems each of which can then be focused on in isolation. This makes solving them easier and is a fundamental programmatical tool. Throughout the years the React library has leveraged these abstractions as a method by which to make the creation of client-side applications easier to manage and more efficient. For React these abstractions are called components and they essentially break up an web application into chunks (an app becomes a collection of pages, a page becomes a collection of its parts, etc...) 

Initially React used classes to represent these component structures, recently however The React library has moved to representing components as functions. These two different methods of representation accomplish the same goal but, go about acheiving it in different ways. Below is a table comparing the difference between the two.  

| Functional Components | Class Components |

| Declaration                              |
